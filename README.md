# What is Codenotes?

## Limitations

Codenotes is still under development, so there are a few limitations to the app. One limitation is that you cannot work with local storage. This is a limitation of working with iframes in the way that Codenotes is implemented.

Another limitation is that you cannot use Codenotes to run code that requires access to the user's system. This is for security purposes.

## Technology Stack

Codenotes is built on the following technology stack:
